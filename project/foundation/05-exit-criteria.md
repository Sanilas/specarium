# Phase 0 Exit Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:

- Authority model is written and unambiguous.
- Operating invariants and non-negotiables are documented.
- Agent roster and mandates are fixed (high-level).
- Spec taxonomy and “spec delta triggers” are defined.
- The above artifacts are ready to be copied into the repo by Codex in Phase 1.

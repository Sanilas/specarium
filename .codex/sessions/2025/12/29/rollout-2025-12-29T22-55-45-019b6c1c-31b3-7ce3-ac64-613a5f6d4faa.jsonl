I want to build...\r\n---\r\n\r\n## User Input\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ARGUMENTS\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\nYou are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\r\n\r\nFollow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\r\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\r\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\r\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\r\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\r\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\r\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\r\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\r\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\r\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\r\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\r\n\r\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\r\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet-explicitly justify any left).\r\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\r\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non-negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\r\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\r\n\r\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment-update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\r\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\r\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\r\n\r\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\r\n   - Version change: old \u001a new\r\n   - List of modified principles (old title \u001a new title if renamed)\r\n   - Added sections\r\n   - Removed sections\r\n   - Templates requiring updates (? updated / ? pending) with file paths\r\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\r\n\r\n6. Validation before final output:\r\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\r\n   - Version line matches report.\r\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\r\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" \u001a replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\r\n\r\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\r\n\r\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\r\n   - New version and bump rationale.\r\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\r\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\r\n\r\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\r\n\r\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\r\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\r\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\r\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\r\n\r\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\r\n\r\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\r\n\r\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\r\n"}}

Market Context\r\n\r\nWithin the German life insurance market, digital sales journeys, underwriting engines, and broker-facing tools exist as largely separate solutions.\r\n\r\n- Insurance companies offer product-specific B2B sales journeys.\r\n- Underwriting engines (often provided by reinsurance companies) assess risk via automated or manual underwriting.\r\n- Brokers must coordinate these components while managing asynchronous, interrupted sales processes involving clients.\r\n\r\nDespite the availability of individual solutions, there is no system that coherently connects these elements into a seamless, broker-centric sales experience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Core Problem\r\n\r\nLife insurance sales processes are inherently asynchronous and interruption-prone.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\n- Dynamic underwriting questions that require later follow-up\r\n- Client input needed outside the broker's presence\r\n- Manual underwriting referrals that pause the sales journey\r\n- Evidence requests that occur after initial data capture\r\n\r\nToday, brokers are forced to manage these interruptions manually across disconnected systems, documents, and communication channels.\r\n\r\nGiven low commission structures, this inefficiency directly impacts broker willingness to sell certain products, particularly those of new or digital-first insurers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Product Proposition\r\n\r\nThe Broker Cockpit is an independent SaaS platform that acts as a **process continuity and orchestration layer** across the life insurance sales lifecycle.\r\n\r\nIt does not replace:\r\n\r\n- Sales journeys\r\n- Underwriting engines\r\n- Insurer core systems\r\n\r\nInstead, it connects them by:\r\n\r\n- Preserving state across asynchronous interactions\r\n- Ensuring consistency and traceability\r\n- Providing brokers with a reliable operational view of ongoing sales processes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Customers and Users\r\n\r\n- **Customers**: Life insurance companies operating under German jurisdiction\r\n- **Users**: Life insurance brokers\r\n\r\nSales journeys associated with insurance products may be:\r\n\r\n- Operated directly by insurers\r\n- Operated by third-party technology providers\r\n- Operated by distribution partners under white-label arrangements\r\n\r\nTechnical ownership of sales journeys is explicitly irrelevant to the Broker Cockpit's role.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Product Boundaries\r\n\r\nThe Broker Cockpit:\r\n\r\n- Operates independently of sales journeys and underwriting engines\r\n- Requires existing product propositions and sales processes to be meaningful\r\n- Does not implement underwriting logic or product pricing\r\n- Does not own the commercial sales proposition\r\n\r\nIts role is to enhance and stabilize existing processes rather than redefine them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Branding & Commercial Model\r\n\r\nThe Broker Cockpit has its own product identity.\r\n\r\nThe SaaS offering supports white-label operation, allowing branding to be adapted to:\r\n\r\n- Insurance company brands\r\n- Distribution partner brands\r\n\r\nBranding does not alter functional behavior, process semantics, or legal traceability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Guiding Principles (Non-Requirements)\r\n\r\n- Broker efficiency is a primary success factor\r\n- Asynchronous processes are the norm, not an exception\r\n- Process continuity is more valuable than UI uniformity\r\n- Integration should not imply ownership or control\r\n- Future automation and AI-based support should be enabled by clear state and semantics, not embedded assumptions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. What This Document Is Not\r\n\r\n- It is not a requirements specification\r\n- It does not define features or user interfaces\r\n- It does not prescribe architecture or implementation\r\n- It must not be translated into tasks or code\r\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 \u001a P2 \u001a P3)\r\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\r\n\r\n### User Story Dependencies\r\n\r\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\r\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\r\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\r\n\r\n### Within Each User Story\r\n\r\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\r\n- Models before services\r\n- Services before endpoints\r\n- Core implementation before integration\r\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\r\n\r\n### Parallel Opportunities\r\n\r\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\r\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\r\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\r\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\r\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\r\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\r\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\r\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\r\n\r\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\r\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\r\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Implementation Strategy\r\n\r\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\r\n\r\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\r\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\r\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\r\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\r\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\r\n\r\n### Incremental Delivery\r\n\r\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational \u001a Foundation ready\r\n2. Add User Story 1 \u001a Test independently \u001a Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\r\n3. Add User Story 2 \u001a Test independently \u001a Deploy/Demo\r\n4. Add User Story 3 \u001a Test independently \u001a Deploy/Demo\r\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\r\n\r\n### Parallel Team Strategy\r\n\r\nWith multiple developers:\r\n\r\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\r\n2. Once Foundational is done:\r\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\r\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\r\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\r\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\r\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\r\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\r\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\r\n- Commit after each task or logical group\r\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\r\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\r\n"}}

No workflow can depend on out-of-band memory or personal trackers.  \n+Rationale: The product’s value is reducing broker friction and liability in asynchronous sales; traceability is mandatory for compliance and dispute resolution.\n+\n+### Contract-Driven Integrations & Idempotent Orchestration\n+Non-negotiable: External sales journeys, underwriting engines, and communications channels are treated as explicit contracts with stable schemas, idempotent operations, and replay-safe orchestration. Breaking changes require staged rollouts, versioned contracts, and backward-compatible fallbacks.  \n+Rationale: The platform does not own upstream journeys; contract discipline prevents outages when partners evolve independently.\n+\n+### Security, Privacy & Tenant Isolation\n+Non-negotiable: Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, and audited role/entitlement changes are required. Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \n+Rationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\n+\n+### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\n+Non-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review.

No workflow can depend on out-of-band memory or personal trackers.  \n+Rationale: The product’s value is reducing broker friction and liability in asynchronous sales; traceability is mandatory for compliance and dispute resolution.\n+\n+### Contract-Driven Integrations & Idempotent Orchestration\n+Non-negotiable: External sales journeys, underwriting engines, and communications channels are treated as explicit contracts with stable schemas, idempotent operations, and replay-safe orchestration. Breaking changes require staged rollouts, versioned contracts, and backward-compatible fallbacks.  \n+Rationale: The platform does not own upstream journeys; contract discipline prevents outages when partners evolve independently.\n+\n+### Security, Privacy & Tenant Isolation\n+Non-negotiable: Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, and audited role/entitlement changes are required. Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \n+Rationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\n+\n+### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\n+Non-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review. SLOs/SLIs for orchestration latency, retry success, and notification delivery are defined and monitored; paging thresholds are documented.  \n+Rationale: Detecting and repairing broken journeys depends on measurable signals and evidence, not intuition.\n+\n+### Incremental Delivery & Testable Slices\n+Non-negotiable: Every user story is independently deployable and testable, with contract tests for external touchpoints and acceptance criteria tied to broker outcomes. Critical paths (resume journey, consent capture, notification dispatch, audit export) require automated checks. Documentation (plan/spec/tasks) must stay in sync with delivered increments.  \n+Rationale: The product must deliver value quickly without coupling stories; testable slices reduce risk in a heavily integrated domain.\n+\n+## Safety, Compliance, and Data Boundaries\n+\n+- Data residency defaults to EU regions; exceptions require explicit risk acceptance and migration plans.  \n+- Consent, evidence requests, and underwriting artifacts are retained per insurer policy with GDPR-aligned deletion and export paths.  \n+- Manual underwriting and evidence uploads must be tamper-evident and traceable to the actor and source system.  \n+- Third-party communications (email/SMS/push) must avoid leaking confidential identifiers outside authenticated channels.\n+\n+## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates\n+\n+- Constitution Check is mandatory before and after design: verify story independence, contract definitions (inputs/outputs, idempotency), data protection controls, observability coverage, and recovery paths for partner failures.  \n+- Plans and specs must call out external contracts, data classifications, and rollback/resume behavior; tasks must group by user story to preserve independent delivery.  \n+- PRs require evidence of automated checks for critical paths and updated documentation links; riskier integrations (identity, consent, payments) require peer review focused on isolation and auditability.  \n+- Feature rollouts must include staged deployment/rollback steps and communication to affected partners/tenants.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- This constitution governs delivery, integration, and quality expectations; conflicting practices are subordinate.  \n+- Amendments require documented rationale, review by product and engineering leads, and an explicit migration or communication plan when partner contracts change.  \n+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance or removed principles, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.  \n+- Compliance: Every plan, spec, and PR must include a Constitution Check summary; violations need written justification and time-bound remediation tracked in tasks.  \n+- Runtime guidance and templates must be updated in the same change set when principles or gates move.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\n*** End Patch"}}

No workflow can depend on out-of-band memory or personal trackers.  \r\nRationale: The product's value is reducing broker friction and liability in asynchronous sales; traceability is mandatory for compliance and dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n### Contract-Driven Integrations & Idempotent Orchestration\r\nNon-negotiable: External sales journeys, underwriting engines, and communications channels are treated as explicit contracts with stable schemas, idempotent operations, and replay-safe orchestration. Breaking changes require staged rollouts, versioned contracts, and backward-compatible fallbacks.  \r\nRationale: The platform does not own upstream journeys; contract discipline prevents outages when partners evolve independently.\r\n\r\n### Security, Privacy & Tenant Isolation\r\nNon-negotiable: Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, and audited role/entitlement changes are required. Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \r\nRationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\r\n\r\n### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\r\nNon-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review. SLOs/SLIs for orchestration latency, retry success, and notification delivery are defined and monitored; paging thresholds are documented.  \r\nRationale: Detecting and repairing broken journeys depends on measurable signals and evidence, not intuition.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Delivery & Testable Slices\r\nNon-negotiable: Every user story is independently deployable and testable, with contract tests for external touchpoints and acceptance criteria tied to broker outcomes. Critical paths (resume journey, consent capture, notification dispatch, audit export) require automated checks. Documentation (plan/spec/tasks) must stay in sync with delivered increments.  \r\nRationale: The product must deliver value quickly without coupling stories; testable slices reduce risk in a heavily integrated domain.\r\n\r\n## Safety, Compliance, and Data Boundaries\r\n\r\n- Data residency defaults to EU regions; exceptions require explicit risk acceptance and migration plans.  \r\n- Consent, evidence requests, and underwriting artifacts are retained per insurer policy with GDPR-aligned deletion and export paths.  \r\n- Manual underwriting and evidence uploads must be tamper-evident and traceable to the actor and source system.  \r\n- Third-party communications (email/SMS/push) must avoid leaking confidential identifiers outside authenticated channels.\r\n\r\n## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates\r\n\r\n- Constitution Check is mandatory before and after design: verify story independence, contract definitions (inputs/outputs, idempotency), data protection controls, observability coverage, and recovery paths for partner failures.  \r\n- Plans and specs must call out external contracts, data classifications, and rollback/resume behavior; tasks must group by user story to preserve independent delivery.  \r\n- PRs require evidence of automated checks for critical paths and updated documentation links; riskier integrations (identity, consent, payments) require peer review focused on isolation and auditability.  \r\n- Feature rollouts must include staged deployment/rollback steps and communication to affected partners/tenants.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\n- This constitution governs delivery, integration, and quality expectations; conflicting practices are subordinate.  \r\n- Amendments require documented rationale, review by product and engineering leads, and an explicit migration or communication plan when partner contracts change.  \r\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance or removed principles, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.  \r\n- Compliance: Every plan, spec, and PR must include a Constitution Check summary; violations need written justification and time-bound remediation tracked in tasks.  \r\n- Runtime guidance and templates must be updated in the same change set when principles or gates move.\r\n\r\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\r\n"}}

No workflow can depend on out-of-band memory or personal trackers.  \r\nRationale: The product's value is reducing broker friction and liability in asynchronous sales; traceability is mandatory for compliance and dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n### Contract-Driven Integrations & Idempotent Orchestration\r\nNon-negotiable: External sales journeys, underwriting engines, and communications channels are treated as explicit contracts with stable schemas, idempotent operations, and replay-safe orchestration. Breaking changes require staged rollouts, versioned contracts, and backward-compatible fallbacks.  \r\nRationale: The platform does not own upstream journeys; contract discipline prevents outages when partners evolve independently.\r\n\r\n### Security, Privacy & Tenant Isolation\r\nNon-negotiable: Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, and audited role/entitlement changes are required. Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \r\nRationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\r\n\r\n### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\r\nNon-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review. SLOs/SLIs for orchestration latency, retry success, and notification delivery are defined and monitored; paging thresholds are documented.  \r\nRationale: Detecting and repairing broken journeys depends on measurable signals and evidence, not intuition.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Delivery & Testable Slices\r\nNon-negotiable: Every user story is independently deployable and testable, with contract tests for external touchpoints and acceptance criteria tied to broker outcomes. Critical paths (resume journey, consent capture, notification dispatch, audit export) require automated checks. Documentation (plan/spec/tasks) must stay in sync with delivered increments.  \r\nRationale: The product must deliver value quickly without coupling stories; testable slices reduce risk in a heavily integrated domain.\r\n\r\n## Safety, Compliance, and Data Boundaries\r\n\r\n- Data residency defaults to EU regions; exceptions require explicit risk acceptance and migration plans.  \r\n- Consent, evidence requests, and underwriting artifacts are retained per insurer policy with GDPR-aligned deletion and export paths.  \r\n- Manual underwriting and evidence uploads must be tamper-evident and traceable to the actor and source system.  \r\n- Third-party communications (email/SMS/push) must avoid leaking confidential identifiers outside authenticated channels.\r\n\r\n## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates\r\n\r\n- Constitution Check is mandatory before and after design: verify story independence, contract definitions (inputs/outputs, idempotency), data protection controls, observability coverage, and recovery paths for partner failures.  \r\n- Plans and specs must call out external contracts, data classifications, and rollback/resume behavior; tasks must group by user story to preserve independent delivery.  \r\n- PRs require evidence of automated checks for critical paths and updated documentation links; riskier integrations (identity, consent, payments) require peer review focused on isolation and auditability.  \r\n- Feature rollouts must include staged deployment/rollback steps and communication to affected partners/tenants.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\n- This constitution governs delivery, integration, and quality expectations; conflicting practices are subordinate.  \r\n- Amendments require documented rationale, review by product and engineering leads, and an explicit migration or communication plan when partner contracts change.  \r\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance or removed principles, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.  \r\n- Compliance: Every plan, spec, and PR must include a Constitution Check summary; violations need written justification and time-bound remediation tracked in tasks.  \r\n- Runtime guidance and templates must be updated in the same change set when principles or gates move.\r\n\r\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\r\n"}}

Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \n Rationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\n \n+### Role-Scoped Access & Contract Awareness\n+Non-negotiable: Every flow, integration, and automation must enforce role clarity (broker, insurer, reinsurer, client, back-office, system) and contract scope before execution. Permissions, data exposure, and side effects must align to the acting role and the relevant integration contract, with explicit handling of delegated and time-bound access.  \n+Rationale: Misapplied roles or contract mismatches are primary sources of data leakage, compliance violations, and partner breakages.\n+\n ### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\n Non-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review. SLOs/SLIs for orchestration latency, retry success, and notification delivery are defined and monitored; paging thresholds are documented.  \n Rationale: Detecting and repairing broken journeys depends on measurable signals and evidence, not intuition.\n@@\n - Amendments require documented rationale, review by product and engineering leads, and an explicit migration or communication plan when partner contracts change.  \n - Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance or removed principles, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.  \n - Compliance: Every plan, spec, and PR must include a Constitution Check summary; violations need written justification and time-bound remediation tracked in tasks.  \n - Runtime guidance and templates must be updated in the same change set when principles or gates move.\n \n-**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\n+**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\n*** End Patch"}}

No workflow can depend on out-of-band memory or personal trackers.  \r\nRationale: The product's value is reducing broker friction and liability in asynchronous sales; traceability is mandatory for compliance and dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n### Contract-Driven Integrations & Idempotent Orchestration\r\nNon-negotiable: External sales journeys, underwriting engines, and communications channels are treated as explicit contracts with stable schemas, idempotent operations, and replay-safe orchestration. Breaking changes require staged rollouts, versioned contracts, and backward-compatible fallbacks.  \r\nRationale: The platform does not own upstream journeys; contract discipline prevents outages when partners evolve independently.\r\n\r\n### Security, Privacy & Tenant Isolation\r\nNon-negotiable: Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, and audited role/entitlement changes are required. Personally identifiable information is minimized, encrypted in transit and at rest, and always associated with tenant partitions; cross-tenant data access is forbidden by default. Delegated access (e.g., to reinsurers) must be time-bound and consent-backed.  \r\nRationale: Broker and client trust, GDPR obligations, and multi-tenant operation demand strict isolation and auditable controls.\r\n\r\n### Role-Scoped Access & Contract Awareness\r\nNon-negotiable: Every flow, integration, and automation must enforce role clarity (broker, insurer, reinsurer, client, back-office, system) and contract scope before execution. Permissions, data exposure, and side effects must align to the acting role and the relevant integration contract, with explicit handling of delegated and time-bound access.  \r\nRationale: Misapplied roles or contract mismatches are primary sources of data leakage, compliance violations, and partner breakages.\r\n\r\n### Observability & Evidence-Backed Operations\r\nNon-negotiable: All flows emit structured logs with correlation IDs, success/error codes, and partner references; business events are captured to an evidence ledger suitable for compliance review. SLOs/SLIs for orchestration latency, retry success, and notification delivery are defined and monitored; paging thresholds are documented.  \r\nRationale: Detecting and repairing broken journeys depends on measurable signals and evidence, not intuition.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Delivery & Testable Slices\r\nNon-negotiable: Every user story is independently deployable and testable, with contract tests for external touchpoints and acceptance criteria tied to broker outcomes. Critical paths (resume journey, consent capture, notification dispatch, audit export) require automated checks. Documentation (plan/spec/tasks) must stay in sync with delivered increments.  \r\nRationale: The product must deliver value quickly without coupling stories; testable slices reduce risk in a heavily integrated domain.\r\n\r\n## Safety, Compliance, and Data Boundaries\r\n\r\n- Data residency defaults to EU regions; exceptions require explicit risk acceptance and migration plans.  \r\n- Consent, evidence requests, and underwriting artifacts are retained per insurer policy with GDPR-aligned deletion and export paths.  \r\n- Manual underwriting and evidence uploads must be tamper-evident and traceable to the actor and source system.  \r\n- Third-party communications (email/SMS/push) must avoid leaking confidential identifiers outside authenticated channels.\r\n\r\n## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates\r\n\r\n- Constitution Check is mandatory before and after design: verify story independence, contract definitions (inputs/outputs, idempotency), data protection controls, observability coverage, and recovery paths for partner failures.  \r\n- Plans and specs must call out external contracts, data classifications, and rollback/resume behavior; tasks must group by user story to preserve independent delivery.  \r\n- PRs require evidence of automated checks for critical paths and updated documentation links; riskier integrations (identity, consent, payments) require peer review focused on isolation and auditability.  \r\n- Feature rollouts must include staged deployment/rollback steps and communication to affected partners/tenants.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\n- This constitution governs delivery, integration, and quality expectations; conflicting practices are subordinate.  \r\n- Amendments require documented rationale, review by product and engineering leads, and an explicit migration or communication plan when partner contracts change.  \r\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking governance or removed principles, MINOR for new/expanded principles, PATCH for clarifications.  \r\n- Compliance: Every plan, spec, and PR must include a Constitution Check summary; violations need written justification and time-bound remediation tracked in tasks.  \r\n- Runtime guidance and templates must be updated in the same change set when principles or gates move.\r\n\r\n**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-29\r\n"}}

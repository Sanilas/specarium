We can refine tone later, but this is already \*\*very solid for public launch\*\*.

\# 5️⃣ Next concrete steps (recommended order)



1\. \*\*Create the new repo\*\*: `specarium` or `specarium-template`

2\. Copy in the \*\*generic layers only\*\* (as discussed earlier)

3\. Replace constitution + templates with \*\*generic versions\*\*

4\. Add the README above

5\. Publish as public



Your \*\*Insurance Broker Cockpit\*\* repo stays untouched and continues as a concrete product built \*on top of\* Specarium.

\## If you want next

I can now help you with:

\- a \*\*generic constitution.md\*\* tailored for Specarium

\- refactoring your current broker-specific constitution into a \*\*product-level extension\*\*

\- a \*\*“Using Specarium for a new project”\*\* guide

\- positioning Specarium for LinkedIn / blog / talks (without buzzwords)



Just tell me what you want to tackle next.
